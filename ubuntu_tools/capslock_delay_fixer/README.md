# CapsLock Delay Fixer

These are two scripts that applied bootstrap.sh from [HexValid's Linux-CapsLock-Delay-Fixer](https://github.com/HexValid/Linux-CapsLock-Delay-Fixer.git) to solve the problem of Linux Operating systems' CapsLock Delay.

Please put HexValid's bootstrap.sh in the same folder with these two scripts, then run CapsLock_Delay_Fix.sh

It will solve the problem and make it as the startup program of Ubuntu Operating System
